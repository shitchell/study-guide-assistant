# study-guide-assistant
A python bottle/CherryPy server that provides a simple API aimed at helping students find answers to study guide questions.

## about
Finding the answers to 100+ questions on a study guide is an arduous task. Since thousands of educators simply recycle and reuse millions of questions, the task of searching for exact phrases and finding the desired answer is fairly easy to automate. This project aims to provide a server that completes this task. When used in conjuction with various tools, it should allow students to easily:

* Find answers to study guides available online using a provided userscript
* Upload study guides and have the answers automatically inserted
* Use the API for any other useful automation tasks
